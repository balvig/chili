# Chili [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/balvig/chili.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/balvig/chili)

Have you ever wanted to test out a new feature on only a subset of users?
Did that implementation end up being lots of if/else statements embedded in the main code?
If so, Chili can help.

Chili is built on top of Rails Engines and Deface and allows you to conditionally add new/modify existing views,
while leaving the main code untouched.

## Tutorial & Examples

- [Walkthrough of creating and releasing a new feature with Chili](http://balvig.github.com/chili/)

## Requirements

- Rails 3.2+
- Ruby 1.9.2+

## Installation

First add Chili to your app's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'chili'
```

and run `bundle`.

## Usage

Chili features are like mini apps that are created inside your main app's lib/chili directory using using the "chili" generator.

### Creating a new chili feature

As an example, assuming you want to add a beta feature named "social" that shows a new like-button
to a subset of users, first within your main app run:

    $ rails g chili:feature social

This will:

1. Create the directory `lib/chili/social_feature` containing the basic structure for the feature
2. Add a reference to the feature to the main app gemfile

Since the feature is mounted as a gem you'll have to restart the app.

### Define who can see the feature

Use the active_if block to control whether new the feature is active for each user.
The context of the active_if block is the application controller so you can use any methods available to that.

```ruby
# {feature}/lib/social_feature.rb
module SocialFeature
  extend Chili::Activatable
  active_if { logged_in? && current_user.admin? } # Feature is only visible to logged in admin users
end
```

### Modifying view templates in main app

Chili uses Deface to dynamically modify existing view templates (see [Deface docs](https://github.com/spree/deface#using-the-deface-dsl-deface-files) for details)
Add overrides to the `app/overides` directory mirroring the path of the view you want to modify.
For example, assuming the main app has the partial `app/views/posts/_post.html.erb`:

```erb
<% # {feature}/app/overrides/posts/_post/like_button.html.erb.deface (folder should mirror main app view path) %>
<!-- insert_bottom 'tr' -->
<td><%= link_to 'Like!', social_feature.likes_path(like: {post_id: post}), method: :post %></td>
```

### Adding new resources

You can run the usual Rails generators for each feature by prepending
the generator with the name of the feature:

```bash
$ rails g social_feature scaffold Like
```

The new resource will be namespaced to `SocialFeature::Like` and automounted as an [isolated engine](http://railscasts.com/episodes/277-mountable-engines?view=asciicast) in the main app at `/chili/social_feature/likes`,
but will only be accessible when active_if is true.

### Migrations

To copy and run feature db migrations use the following command:

    $ rake social_feature:db:migrate

### Modifying existing models

Create a model with the same name as the one you want to modify by running: `rails g social_feature model User --migration=false` and edit it to inherit from the original:

```ruby
# {feature}/app/models/social_feature/user.rb
module SocialFeature
  class User < ::User
    has_many :likes
  end
end
```

Access in your overrides/feature views through the namespaced model:

```erb
<%= SocialFeature::User.first.likes %>
<%= current_user.becomes(SocialFeature::User).likes %>
```

### Stylesheets/javascripts

Files added to the feature's `app/assets/social_feature/javascripts|stylesheets` directory are automatically injected into the layout using a pre-generated override:

```erb
<% # {feature}/app/overrides/layouts/application/assets.html.erb.deface %>
<!-- insert_bottom 'head' -->
<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'social_feature/application' %>
<%= javascript_include_tag 'social_feature/application' %>
```

If you don't need any css/js in your feature, you can remove this file.

## Gotchas

- Chili will not be able to automount if you use a catch-all route in your main app (ie `match '*a', to: 'errors#routing'`), you will have to remove the catch-all or manually add the engine to the main app's routes file.
- Just like normal engines, Chili requires you to prepend path helpers with `main_app` (ie `main_app.root_path` etc) in view templates that are shared with the main app (such as the main app's application layout file).
